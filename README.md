## What is going on
This project builds on [Mediapipe](https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/demos/hand-pose-detection/index.html?model=mediapipe_hands)'s hand recognition in order to create a mini-solar system with [Three.JS](https://threejs.org/).
Assets from Sanderblue's [Solar System](https://github.com/sanderblue/solar-system-threejs).

### Supported:
- Snap to create the stars
- Snap to create the sun
- Flick to move sun into center
- Finger wave to make the sun spin
- Snap to create Earth (and Mars)
- Finger wave to make Earth/Mars spin
- Flick up to move Earth/Mars into orbit
- Using hands to rotate and dolly the camera


## Bugs
Yes, there will be. Issues/contributions are welcome.
